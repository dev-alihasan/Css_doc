## Selectors:
  >Targeting Elements:
  1. Selectors are used to target specific elements on a webpage.
  2. You define selectors followed by curly braces {} where you specify the properties and their values.

```css
    selector {
    property: value;
    /* more properties... */
    }
```
  >Targeting by Class:
  1. You can target elements with a specific class using a dot (.) followed by the class name.
  2. This is useful when you want to style multiple elements with the same class.
```css
.class1 { }
```
